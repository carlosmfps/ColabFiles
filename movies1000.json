Awesome.\n\nI waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I?

An excellent and original adaption.\n\nAn American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.\n-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.\n-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\n\n\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\n\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\n\"It's worse,\" Latham says.\n\nA short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\n\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"\n\nA wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.\n-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.\n-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.\n-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\n\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\n\"Humbug?\"", "summary": "Original, Amrerican, Thought Provoking and Unique", "unixReviewTime": 1224892800}

Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three \"ghosts\" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the \"romantic\" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.

Jamele", "reviewText": "I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.\n\nI have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.

They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.\nYou can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift.

Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: \"Outstanding Miniseries.\" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular \"Bible Collection\" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as \"proof.\" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish", "summary": "Initially, bound and betrayed.

And yes, the ending of this film shall bring tears to one's eyes. For any who are not familiar with scripture, then see this film. Any who does read scripture, as I do, then see this film as well.

The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\"Blessed be His name\")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.

I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.\n\nThis miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.\n\nSeveral reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you.", "summary": "Magnificent!

The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).\n\nIt's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it!

This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her \"please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear.\" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the \"prostitute\" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.\n\nTo the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very \"PG-13\" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his \"lover,\" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me).

Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film.", "summary": "Superb dramatization of the Old Testament story of Joseph", "unixReviewTime": 1172620800}

There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery.

It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.\nEveryone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph.

It shows very clearly  why Joseph is a truly great hero figure : Firstly, he distinguished himself  by service and respect, to God, to his human master, and to his people (in  that fixed order), putting himself a poor fourth; this contrasts sharply to  many other so-called great men of history who\ndistinguished themselves  through conquest. Secondly, he overcame all of the serious setbacks in his  troubled life, as opposed to most of us, who are overcome by our  disasters.\nThe production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the \"rape\", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story.\nThe performances of Ben Kingsley  (Potiphar) and Martin Landau (Jacob) are superb, and Paul Mercurio  (Joseph), despite his necessary youth and therefore less experience, does a  good job,  although his \"body language\" often outdoes his spoken  one.\nThere are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant / commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of \"7 years\",  is not always the most probable one.\nBut overall this is an excellent,  well recommended telling of the story of Joseph the Patriach.", "summary": "Joseph (1995)", "unixReviewTime": 960336000}

You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.\n\nMr. Gibson's \"The Passion\" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)\n\nThis is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense \"The Passion.\"\n\nThis film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the \"Gospel According to Luke.\"  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.\n\nAlright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.\n\nI'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read \"Luke,\" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.\n\nThe sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in \"The Passion.\" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.\n\nLike I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,\" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.\n\nAnother thing I should point out is that \"The Passion\" is NOT child friendly. \"Jesus of Nazareth\" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of \"The Passion.\" But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from \"Luke.\" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in \"The Passion.\"\n\nAnother thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written \"Good News Bible.\"\n\nI like \"Jesus of Nazareth\" and \"The Passion.\" And I can suggest this film as well without reservation.", "summary": "Beautiful Masterpiece, Yet Child Friendly Too.", "unixReviewTime": 1396569600}

I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.

At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks \"who acted as this man's neighbor?\" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.\n\nIn the film you will often hear background voices.  For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins.  As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, \"only a mite?\" \"can't she give more?\" \"it's very little.\"  These sayings are not documented in the gospel but again, do not detract from the message; rather they emphasize our own sinful nature and our need to repent.", "summary": "I am writing to you, most excellent Theophilus...", "unixReviewTime": 1208044800}

The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.\n\nThe Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.\n\nBrian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.\n\nMany of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).\n\nWhat is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.\n\nThere are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:\n\nBesides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.\n\nThere is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.\n\nEven though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.  The biggest plus of this movie is how faithful it is to the biblical text.

This definitive, rigorously scriptural movie version of the life of Jesus Christ has been seen by over five billion people around the globe, reaching 236 different nations in over 800 languages.  It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion.\nThe movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him.\nThe suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.  Even non-Christians will be impressed by the commitment, scrupulous attention to detail, and cinematic mastery that went into the making of this film.", "summary": "The most widely viewed film of all time", "unixReviewTime": 1083196800}

It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.\n\nIF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.\n\nAND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled \"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July\".", "summary": "Not the real Frosty sequel- see \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\" for real sequel", "unixReviewTime": 1133827200}

One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.\n\nAs the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.\n\nIt starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.\n\nThe baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.\n\nI'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.\n\nOne drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.\n\nNot helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.\n\nKids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.  Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come.", "summary": "Have Questions about Santa?  Get the Answers Here", "unixReviewTime": 1431388800}

The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.\n\nThe special was created using stop motion animation called \"Animagic,\" in which all the characters are made out of wood and plastic and animated via stop-motion photography. The special was originally telecast December 14, 1970 by ABC and continues to air every year on sibling channel ABC Family, though both channels have at times edited the special to make room for commercials (ABC has cut two key songs, as well as two other songs in half; ABC Family has cut several scenes that might be traumatizing to younger viewers, like Kris climbing, and leaping to escape to prevent children from doing dangerous stunts, Winter Warlock knowing Kris will return, & telling him he'll never escape including the scene where the Burgermeister Meisterburger character torches the seized toys in front of the children of Sombertown).\n\n`Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was written by Rankin-Bass' go-to writer, Romeo Muller, who explores all aspects of Santa Claus' origins. Narrated by a mailman named Kluger [Fred Astaire], this hour-long special dissects the development of Kris' selflessness, and covers the origins of his beard, hearty laugh, crew of helpers, need to go down the chimney, North Pole residency (he needs to hide from Burgermeister, after all), and pretty much everything in between, providing a hugely creative look at how Santa came to be. On top of being edifying, it's wonderfully entertaining too, full of delightful set-pieces and tender moments of humour.\n\nWhereas today's film makers use 3D computer animation, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was executed with stop-motion technology, using models and sets to painstakingly create each frame. It does look dated and rough at times, not to mention the pacing does occasionally drag, but there's something charming about this primitive technique, especially when you consider just how much work went into every second of screen-time. Rankin-Bass movies often featured impressive casts, with the pair securing at least one or two major names for each production. `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' has two big names, with Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire both lending their vocal talents to the film. Astaire is a huge asset, guiding us through the story with energy and charm. He has a great singing voice, too, which enlivens the numerous musical set-pieces. Mickey Rooney, meanwhile, submits well-judged work with plenty of heart.\n\nFor over four decades now, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' has been part of annual Christmastime traditions in many households, but mainly in North America, and deservingly so. Romeo Muller's screenplay covers the origins of many holiday traditions - including hiding gifts in stockings and how reindeer fly, while also delivering an uplifting reminder about the real meaning of the season of giving.\n\nBlu-ray Video Quality - This 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray release of `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' features a full 1080p High Definition presentation utilising the 1.33:1 [4:3] Standard Aspect Ratio in which it was originally broadcast. The video presentation looks pretty outstanding for a TV special especially for its age and all of the colours and detail look spot on, easily the best this classic family TV special event has ever been presented. Fans of this TV special should be thrilled with this high definition video presentation and the newcomers to it couldn't possibly find a better way to experience it for the first time. Because it was original made for North America Television, you can see where the adverts were inserted, because you see it fade out, with such a Classic Christmas Special transferred to the Blu-ray format, you think they could of made and effort to edit it in a much more professional way and got hold of the original master tape? I suspect when people viewed this on the DVD format, you would not see the black strings holding up the puppets. But now seeing it in the video resolution of 1080p, you can see very clearly the black string, still after a while you forget seeing this anomaly.\n\nBlu-ray Audio Quality - While it states that the main soundtrack is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, we are instead treated to a  5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack which isn't too shabby and it's certainly a pleasant surprise to find a multichannel soundtrack of any sort present for such an old special. While as one would expect, the surround element may not provide much in the way of background effects, the special sounds are pretty great here nonetheless and I think overall most will be pretty satisfied with this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, especially if you have not got the facility of a Home Cinema set-up.\n\nBlu-ray Special Features and Extras:\n\nSadly none has been provided.\n\nFinally, amongst Christmas specials, but particularly amongst those produced by Rankin and Bass, `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' stands apart. It does so because it is most the most triumphantly well-told of the lot, soon I will describe the most cinematic but here we're talking strictly based on narrative. This may just be Romeo Muller's, the writer Rankin/Bass employed, best work as he makes Santa an even more heroic figure because in this tale we learn of his past, learn to think of him as a person not just an icon, and then also have an antagonist who vilifies him and renders him an outlaw. You have, of course, the talents of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney in this tale and the indelible figures of the Winter Warlock and Bergermeister Meisterberger and of course another classic song. It is an absolutely unbeatable combination and one of the best options for the festive season. Highly Recommended!\n\nAndrew C.

The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation \"on two's and three's\" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.\n\nWhen I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, \"Be Prepared to Pay\" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).\n\nSanta Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.\n\nIn this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says \"It's not even safe here,\" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.\n\nOkay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray. For more about Rankin/Bass and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.\n\nNOTE: If you have the original DVD of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.", "summary": "Santa Claus comes to Blu-ray", "unixReviewTime": 1322352000}

Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word \"Claus\" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.\n\nThis was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful \"My World is Beginning Today\" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with \"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.\n\nIn addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.", "summary": "Rankin/Bass classic is near the top of their game", "unixReviewTime": 1261612800}

He really enjoyed it, as it is one of those timeless Christmas shows that every kid loves at Christmas.\n\nBut there was an entire musical number cut from the TV presentation. Perhaps you remember when Jessica (the sexy puppet, who eventually becomes Mrs. Claus) has to free Kris Kringle from jail. And in doing this, she is struck with intense liberation and sexual feelings for him, that cause her to let her hair down out of it's bun for the first time ever (she was kind of a stuck up school teacher at the beggining, remember?) and dance around and sing in this psychedelic flower garden-fantasy sequence.\n\nIt is the most out of place scene in the movie, and I guess I can understand the network execs desicion in leaving it out (ABC is Disney owned these days) it's probably considered either too controversial, or just too dated,... or the fact that it looks like most cartoon animators in the seventies were on tons of acid, I'm not sure. But at any rate, as somewhat of an obsessive when it comes to small details, I couldn't get over the fact that the scene was just gone. This happens alot lately on TV. I watched Willy Wonka on TV with my kid one time and noticed that the entire psychedelic boat ride scene was chopped.\n\nBut thats what really makes the DVDs a good bet with these spcials.

A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.\n\nUnder dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.\n\nVarious facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!\n\nDetermined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.\n\nWhether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting.

It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.\n\nProduced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J. Fred Coots' inspirational classic \"Santa Claus is Comin' To Town.\" These include \"First Toymaker To the King,\" \"Be Prepared to Pay (Santa's Song),\" \"Put One Foot in Front of the Other,\" \"My World is Beginning Today,\" and \"What Better Way to Tell You (Christmas Carol).\" Of course, the title song is saved for last and Astaire makes you think it has always been your song.\n\nThe story is told by a mailman, effectively voiced by Fred Astaire, who takes time out from all of his holiday deliveries to set the tone for this charming holiday tale and narrate the evetns. I think of this as being a contemporary of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin). The Island of Misfit Toys makes the other one the more beloved Holiday classic, but this one is a close second, and Jessica is the cutest future Mrs. Claus of all-time.", "summary": "The charming story of how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus", "unixReviewTime": 1070323200}

I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.\nSANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.\nThis was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.\nI suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while. Even though I now own the vhs of SCICTT and soon will purchase the DVD I make myself and my kids wait until Christmas season to watch it.

It is STOP MOTION animation. Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques.\nThis fact aside, \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\" is the very best of the wonderful Rankin/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun.\nAll the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive.\nThe songs are excellent, from the familiar \"Santa Claus is Coming To Town\" to the lovely \"My World Is Beginning Today\" sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.)\nThe script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.\nThis has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV.

When I heard that the first two volumes in the new Holy Land Series were released on DVD, I immediately knew I had to go shopping! :)\n\nDave Stotts, the host of Drive Thru History again brings viewers into the world of fascinating history in Volume 1: Egypt to Qumran - Covenants, Kings, and the Promised Land; and in Volume 2: Jericho to Megiddo - Conquest, Canaanites, and the Holy City. Each volume contains three episodes for a total of 85-90 minutes.\n\nTypical of Dave Stotts, he brings history to life with his intriguing historical facts and well-done visual effects. And let's not forget his quirky humor! This time he drives through Israel in a Fiat, traveling the roads to the places of Jerusalem, Masada, Samaria, Shiloh, and Beersheeba, just to name a few.\n\nAs I watched these movies, I had several \"ah hah\" moments, as I connected the words of the Bible with the places Dave visited. I was able to put a visual with the accounts in the Bible, including the place where David slayed Goliath and the place where Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well. The archeological evidence is astounding! My favorite part was seeing the place where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and then finding out a bit about the men who discovered the amazing scrolls while herding sheep.\n\nPerfect for families, homeschoolers, youth groups, and anyone who loves history, especially Biblical and ancient history, these newest volumes of Drive Thru History are a must have for any DVD library. There is nothing objectionable in either volume, although young children may not yet be interested. Also, the brief information about David slaying Goliath may scare very young viewers if they are not familiar with the account.\n\nI highly recommend these latest volumes in the Drive Thru History saga and have added it to my listing of mom-approved movies for families on my wordpress blog.\n\nReviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of \"77 Ways Your Family Can Make a Difference: Ideas and Activities for Serving Others.\"", "summary": "Another highly-recommended Drive Thru History!", "unixReviewTime": 1330473600}

Our cable provider listed out Holiday shows in the Kids Section during the Season and I found it one year so I got the family together and we watched it. I ended up purchasing it on DVD since it wasn't on the following Christmas and I didn't have Prime at that time. Anyway, on to the review ...\n\nThe show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch. The usual cast of characters are there and we learn a little more about each of them and what they do during their own Holiday celebrations. Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.\n\nMarc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world. As such, their reactions provide lots of opportunities to talk to your kids about what is happening during the show. At least, that's how we watch shows. : )\n\nFinal analysis, enjoyable Holiday fare; fun for the whole family.", "summary": "You'll learn some new things about each character and have lots to talk about with your kids", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000}

Created by Marc Brown and based on his books, Arthur Read is an aardvark who shares adventures (and misadventures!) with friends like Buster Baxter (a rabbit), Francine Frensky (a monkey), Binky Barnes (a bulldog), Muffy Crosswire (a very RICH monkey), and others. Arthur is often at odds with his little sister D.W. (Dora Winifred) which makes for much of the shows comedic moments.\n\nIn Arthur's Perfect Christmas, the scene begins with Arthur sitting at the piano, softly playing Pachebel's Canon. This movie, like the TV show, uses day-dream sequences--and Arthur plunges into a snazzy song called \"Perfect Christmas\". You see, this holiday, Aruthur wants it to be absolutely PERFECT...but things go wrong in the town of Elwood City, for both Arthur AND his friends!\n\nFor example, Muffy expects Francine to attend her big Christmas party, but Francine has told Muffy REPEATEDLY that her family is having a Hannukah gathering the same night. What happens when Francine doesn't show up for the party to receive her present?\n\nBuster Baxter worries about his Mom who seems to obsess over having a perfect Christmas for her son, especially since the divorce. Buster comes up with \"Baxter Day\" which takes the pressure of his Mom and displays the true meaning of the holidays--love and kindness.\n\nArthur searches the mall for presents for his parents, D.W. is desperate for a Tina the Talking Tabby (whose theme song haunts Arthur everywhere he goes!), Uncle Fred makes an unexpected visit on his way to a Floridian Christmas, and Arthur's Dad insists on making an \"authentic\" dinner that was likely served in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago.\n\nHolidays such as Kwanzaa and Hanukkah are also highlighted making this a fun and informative DVD.\n\nI bought the Arthur's Perfect Christmas DVD for my son several years ago and it's STILL his favorite. I just brought out the Christmas DVD's and VHS's and he plays this one several times a day. It's filled with fun songs (24 of them!), witty banter, and clever wordplay. Not only that, there's a great message that expectations often disappoint and that a wonderful experience can arise out of mishaps and situations not going as planned.\n\nThis 60 minute DVD doesn't have any extras (except for previews of other Arthur DVD's), but this excellent movie is well worth the price in my opinion. My husband and I get a kick out of the cleverness shown in Arthur TV series and this movie is no exception. And as I said, it's my son's favorite holiday movie.\n\nHighly recommended for kids and parents alike!", "summary": "Excellent Holiday Movie!", "unixReviewTime": 1132704000}

Although it is a one-joke premise, the directing and editing manage to keep things moving fast enough that it doesn't get old.\nThe 8-minute short opens with George Lucas, in his last semester at film school, unable to finish his final project, Space Wheat, which begins \"Not Long Ago in a Nearby Galaxy.\"  His teacher (a stubby guy who talks like a certain Jedi Master) is no real help, and it isn't until he meets a girl with hair wrapped tightly in donut-buns (a stunning Lisa Jakob, of Independence Day fame) that he finds a muse who encourages the young Lucas to \"write what he knows.\"  What he knows is the dozens of Star Wars references surrounding him, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nAs much an homage as it is a parody, Lucas in Love succeeds where so many others fail.  A review of the three other shorts on the DVD - \"Evil Hill\" (Dr. Evil meets Notting Hill), Film Club (Fight Club in a film school), and Swing Blade (Sling Blade mixed with Swingers) easily demonstrates how this type of experiment can fall flat on its face, turning into a gigglefest by filmmakers and audiences with the kinds of noses that stick up in the air.  Thankfully, Lucas in Love is never reduced to this insipid level of \"didja get it?  didja?  aren't we CLEVER!!!) that the other films on the DVD do (and, unfortunately, so many other short films available on the Internet).\nThe DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a \"making of\" that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff.  The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one.  There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD.  Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film.\nIs it worth the money for this DVD?  Up to you.  Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are.  You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it.  Besides, it's great to roll out for your friends and show them without boring them.", "summary": "Wow and Wow Again!", "unixReviewTime": 999388800}

From Lucas' roommate Benji talking about an 'all powerful force' to his friends Hal & Chuck  working on Hal's 'fastest thing on campus' to a professor whose speech  patterns resembled a well known Jedi Master, this film has a heck of a lot  crammed into it's 9 minutes.  If anything, the filmmakers should have done  a 15-20 minute film! The film was very clever and enjoyable.

Anyone who didn't enjoy this at least a  little really needs to get a sense of humor.  Of course, it's a bit cheesy,  but it's meant to be that way.  It's presented in the slightly corny,  overblown way that 'Hardware Wars' or the 'Naked Gun' films were. The same  people who didn't understand those films probably won't understand 'George  Lucas In Love'.  It's not a 'great' film, but who cares?

In that respect, it's one of the more disorganized guitar instructional videos I've seen. Despite Paul's youth and enthusiasm,, the material gets relatively advanced rather quickly (and he can play the licks so fast and perfect, it's just as discouraging as inspirational).\n\nIn Part 2, he sporadically mentions things that would be aimed at relative beginners...which definitely doesn't belong on these videos.  On the other hand, Example #7 is so much more intricate/difficult than anything else on this disk, it seems out of place.  The best thing on the whole disk are the 2-note per string/string skipping arpeggios (wish I woulda started practicing those 10 years ago). There are a couple of other cool licks, but the video ends up a mess of a lot of talking...my mind wandered.\n\nBefore attempting to play along, you should already know all the major scale modes and the melodic minor scale.  Your alternate picking should already be very controlled/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping.  It also contains some extreme finger stretches/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).\n\nIf you don't already have the skills mentioned above, I highly recommend Don Latarski's \"Guitar Theory Basics\" and Frank Gambale's \"Chopbuilder\" be bought first.

There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the \"Spritual Warm-Up\", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular \"stretching\" video.\n\nThe practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.\n\nThe introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to \"Acres 4 Life\" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.\n\nIf you're looking for a couple excellent (non-demoninational) well produced stretching DVD's, I would recommend the following:\nFull Body Stretch by Karen Voight\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Full-Body-Stretch/dp/B00467182C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Full Body Stretch</a>\n\nCool it Off by Mary Schaefer\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cool-It-Off-Debbie-Siebers-Slim-Series-Stretch-Recovery-Workout-DVD/dp/B000A3XER8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cool It Off - Debbie Siebers' Slim Series: Stretch/Recovery Workout ( DVD)</a>\n\nTotal Body Stretching by Cathe Friedrich\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cathe-Friedrich-s-Total-Body-Stretching-DVD/dp/B000B872PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cathe Friedrich's Total Body Stretching DVD</a>\nand Stretch Max\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stretch-Max-with-Cathe-Friedrich/dp/B001E65A8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stretch Max with Cathe Friedrich</a>\n\nDeep Stretch with Mimi Solaire\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Deep-Stretch-Yin-Yoga-with-Mimi-Solaire/dp/B001JT6Y8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Deep Stretch/ Yin Yoga with Mimi Solaire</a>\nand Back in Shape\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Back-in-Shape/dp/B0001BRMUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Back in Shape</a>\n\nSave Your Lower Back with Annetee Fletcher\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Save-Your-Lower-Back-Release-Strengthen-Stretch-with-Annette-Fletcher/dp/B00097C4B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Save Your Lower Back - Release, Strengthen, Stretch with Annette Fletcher</a>\nand Stretch & Joint Mobility\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stretch-and-Joint-Mobility-Therapy/dp/B00095MBNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stretch and Joint Mobility Therapy</a>\n\nPilates for Flexibility by Amy Brown\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pilates-for-Life-Pilates-for-Flexibility/dp/B000BNKB14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pilates for Life: Pilates for Flexibility</a>", "summary": "Postpartum Yoga-Lite and Prayer", "unixReviewTime": 1339372800}

A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.\n\nThe first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.\n\nThe film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.\n\nOliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.\n\nWhile the description might superficially resemble Kick-Ass (2010), the movie features a comic book artist living out his heroic fantasies, one has really nothing to do with the other.\n\nThe animated title sequence is by Richard Williams?

(1985), with an American civilian mixed up in international intrigue. And as much as I still like Gotcha!, Condorman is the superior movie. Gotcha! is all nerdy hormones and awkwardness, while Condorman just rolls out fantastic comic book surprises one after the next.\n\nFor an actor whose career apparently peaked with this movie, Michael Crawford does a great job and is very likeable. James Hampton is a guy with not a ton of name recognition, but has a ton of face recognition, and is great in this movie. Barbara Carrera went on to be a Bond girl opposite Sean Connery 2 years later, and is very much a Bond girl here and Oliver Reed plays a menacing villain.\n\nEven though The Cat From Outer Space (1978) has more than 6 actors with speaking lines, and a cast filled with recognizable stars from TV and Disney movies, Condorman is just as much fun.\n\nThe Region 2 Disney UK DVD comes with no special features. Audio options are English, French and German. With Subtitles options being English, French and German as well. The credits all come at the beginning of the movie, which was how credits were done until George Lucas changed the industry with Star Wars, so the lack of end credits seems a bit jarring. When I played this on my computer with the VLC player, there was black bars both below and on the side of the image. But in my multiregion Blu Ray player, the image wiled my widescreen TV.\n\nSeveral UK sellers on Amazon are selling this for under $10 plus shipping and at that price, you can't go wrong with this DVD, if you have the ability to play other region DVDs.", "summary": "Still holds up great - Great Fun!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1429315200}

Bala", "reviewText": "CONDORMAN was a childhood favorite of mine, and, brother, I have been waiting impatiently for a Region 1 DVD to get my mitts on. So it's about time (but now I'm cheesed with the DVD's lack of special features). I find it really hard to be objective with CONDORMAN, this film being such a cherished memory. Having seen it again very recently, I can't help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.\n\nSome SPOILERS now, peppered throughout.\n\nA conscientious comic book artist, Woody Wilkins won't put anything in his comics which his characters couldn't do in real life. As such, the movie opens in Paris with Woody gigged out in full Condorman regalia and leaping off the Eiffel Tower to test his Condorman wings. It sucks for him that the wings malfunction and he ends up diving into the Seine river. So right away you get a sense of what this cat is like: an adventurous dreamer.\n\nWoody thinks that his friend Harry's job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he's merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.\n\nCut to some time later, and we finally get to the central plot. The CIA learns that a Soviet KGB operative codenamed the Bear wants to defect, but that the Bear wants only the agent known as Condorman to act as the primary facilitator. Woody is initially reluctant, but caves when he learns that the Bear is actually Natalia (who's mistaken Woody for a top agent) and that the CIA has agreed to bring his comic book designs to life. The rest of the film treats us to more globetrotting exploits, zany secret agent and superhero antics, and a whiff of romance.\n\nSo, if you're a kid at heart, CONDORMAN should be right up your alley. One of its strongest points is that it does a good job of massaging your sense of wish fulfillment. Because who hasn't daydreamed of accomplishing daring deeds, of coming out the hero and winning that girl? CONDORMAN is awesomely nerdtacular.\n\nMichael Crawford, if you remember him at all, is more famous for stuff like HELLO, DOLLY and for playing the Phantom of the Opera on stage (for which, to give him his just due, he garnered massive props). Crawford is skinny, gangly, boasts a non-heroic voice, and isn't who you first think of when drawing up the prototypical intrepid man of action. But he's good as the comic book creator/nerd with aspirations of derring-do. This is a Disney flick, so, it's certainly wholesome enough and its sensibilities lean toward the youngsters. A  film like this can get away with a character like Woody Wilkins, a \"foolish dreamer who draws comic books\" who then takes on the identity of one of his creations.\n\nIt helps that Condorman has a supporting cast who mostly plays it straight, notably Oliver Reed as the sinister Russian masterspy Krakov, Barbara Carrera as the exotic femme fatale Natalia, and James Hampton who plays Woody's amiable pal and CIA contact Harry Oslo. Jean-Pierre Kalfon, the sorta scary one-eyed Russian hitman Morovich, does it over-the-top, but, really, what else can you do when you're sporting a menacing glass eye and tearing down the Yugoslavian roads in an intimidating black Porsche? And, man, watching this film again just brings back those good old days, when the Iron Curtain was still up and the U.S. and the USSR were still kicking it Cold War. The prevailing thought back then was that the Russian Bear would be a superpower forever...\n\nCONDORMAN is loosely based on Robert Sheckley's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Game-of-X/dp/0441273084/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Game of X</a>, which I haven't read but have just now ordered online because I hear good things about it. Catering to Woody's intent that Condorman be an international crime fighter, his plan to help Natalia defect involves their navigating a circuitous route, from Yugoslavia to the Swiss Alps to a final showdown in Monte Carlo. Considering that they end up running a gauntlet of enemy operatives in all their stops, they might as well have taken a direct flight home. But where's the fun in that, right? I thought it a perfect touch that Krakov is able to anticipate Condorman and Natalia's itinerary simply by reading Woody's comic books.\n\nWhen I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn't really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I'm glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment. I wish, though, that we'd seen something of Woody's other creations. I can't help being intrigued by the likes of Gopher Boy, Bazooka Boy, and Laser Girl.

About Woody (Crawford) who is a comic book writer who's best friend Harry (Michael J Fox's father in Teen Wolf/Longest Yard (original) guy who dies) is a file clerk for a spy company, who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers, he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent (Natalia) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.\n\nWoody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia's boss/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape, in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.\n\nSeeing this again many years later, I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action/adventure comedy. But, it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days, and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.\n\nThe character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent who doesn't always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys, but by unintentional luck, but gets the girl in the end. Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time, and that is about what Condorman is.\n\nA lot of humor, zany antics, car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.\n\nIgnore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks... they are ripping you off hard. The DVD quality is not that great, it kind of looks like it was done straight from an old VHS to DVD without bothering to clean it up. And there is no bonus features. This DVD deserves more respect then this, and I hope Disney decide to do a special edition of it someday.\n\nOh yeah, not to forget, the second hand sellers are selling the out of print region 1 version... the DVD is still in print in region 4 for about 10 bucks, and includes another film with it too. And don't worry about the region stuff, they play in any old computers DVD player.

It was 1981 and I had saved up my pocket money to pay for the bus ride into the city and the admission for a matinee to a movie that seemed so exciting and lively to me.\n\nI had read the book 'The Game of X' by Robert Sheckley as well as the adaptation of the movie by Heather Simon and imagined every scene in my head as I had gone through it. The movie was everything a young boy could have hoped for - a rollicking, comedic adventure with a very beautiful female Russian agent (Carrera) and a sinister KGB chief (played by Oliver Reed).\n\nThe only problem I have with this movie is the miscasting of Michael Crawford as Woody Wilkins, the cartoonist who helps out a friend of his at the CIA office in Paris. Englishman Crawford puts on the most exaggerated American accent imagineable, although admittedly he has the brilliant comedic timing necessary to pull off this role.\n\nThe CIA in France has a problem. They need a civilian to act as a courier to Istanbul. Of course Woody gets the job, but right from the start it's obvious he is taking his role just a little too seriously. By the time he arrives to meet his KGB contact in Turkey he has fully assumed the role of his cartoon creation - top CIA agent and superhero Condorman.\n\nBarbara Carrera (who two years later would get to play a Bond girl - the very movies this one attempts to lampoon) plays KGB agent Natalia. Later, when she makes the decision to defect, the impressive Condorman comes to mind as the only CIA agent she will trust to handle her defection.\n\nThe only problem is the CIA does not have an agent with the codename Condorman.\n\nWhat follows is an adventure filled race across Europe with enough gadgets to fill several Bond movies. There is some great car chases (performed by legendary French stunt driver Remy Julienne and his 16-man crew of drivers and mechanics), boat chases and along the way Crawford sports some of the most outrageous disguises in cinema history. It's all great fun and it's executed perfectly.\n\nFor high flying escapist entertainment they don't come much more downright enjoyable than this. The DVD is a disappointment with no special features to speak off except a rather slim production notes section in the inside cover booklet. It's 2 pages of notes on the making of the movie, with sections on 'The Story,' 'The Setting,' 'Gadgetry' and 'Stunts and Special Effects,' but it's all very slim pickings.\n\nBut, I've had this movie in my DVD collection for over two years and on those quiet rainy Saturday's it's a particular favorite (along with 1980s FLASH GORDON) to put in my DVD player and sit back and remember a more innocent time in my life.\n\nRecommended for all dreamers.", "summary": "Condorman - a top secret cartoonist", "unixReviewTime": 1091232000}

Wheeler", "reviewText": "For some reason it seems fashionable to criticize this production, mainly because it carries old footage from Masterpiece Theatre, hosted by Russell Baker.  Further, this film was sponsored by Mobil Oil Co. and produced by the BBC.  In addition, some reviewers may see it competing with the classic starring John Mills and Alec Guinness from 1947.  Moreover, since this 1999 film was made, weve had the 2011 production starring Gillian Anderson and other versions, as well.  But viewers who fail to see this 3-hour epic from 1999 are really missing the best rendition of what may be Charles Dickens best novel.  The story is timeless and inspiring; the romance, touching and well-portrayed.  TV simply cant be better than this.\n\nCasting is almost perfect with a young Ioan Gruffudd playing the grown up Pip and Gabriel Thomson the young Pip.  They look so much alike youd swear they're related in real life.  Beyond this, Charlotte Rampling seems an ideal choice for the quirky Miss Havisham, as does Justine Waddell playing the wounded Estella.  Other cast members, like those playing Magwich, Jaggers, Herbert Pocket, Joe, Wemmick, Molly, et al are equally well-chosen.\n\nThe ending of this story is not really a happy one.  Abel Magwich meets a grisly end, Miss Havisham is burned alive, and the romance between Pip and Estella seems to be in limbo.  One has to be reminded that Charles Dickens wrote the story and did two versions of the ending.  This is the happier of the two.\n\nI don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they find fault with how dark and grim this production seems.  Im sure its exactly what Dickens would have wanted and exactly right for 1999.  No, I wouldnt object if the video were re-mastered into true HD-widescreen but I felt Id waited long enough to see this flim again.  No sign of a re-generation was found from BBC so I purchased it at a decent price on the secondary market.  If and when a re-mastered version of this classic appears I will want to buy it.\n\nSumming up, those who haven't seen this version of Great Expectations shouldnt wait any longer.  Go and buy a copy from one of the Amazon re-sellers like I did.  This is the best version you will find and its production values are fine for now.  When a re-mastered version is released, Ill buy it.", "summary": "The Best of Charles Dickens", "unixReviewTime": 1390694400}

Dickens is so cruel we cannot imagine he is a man, what's more a humane human being.\n\nA poor orphan, Pip, is raised by a poor blacksmith. A life of rough and tough luck. Take it or leave it, but there is no way out, except the radical one. And he dreams of being a gentleman one day. An aberration of course, morally wrong and bad taste.\n\nHe is selected and invited by Miss Havisham, a deranged rich woman who is mourning in total decay and sorrow after the failure of her wedding when the bridegroom did not come, twenty years before. Her objective is to provide a male companion and eventually husband to her adopted daughter, Estella.\n\nBut one night on the moor Pip is \"accosted\" by an prison escapee of some kind who asks for food and the boy of six or seven, maybe eight provides in the night, including a file for him to get rid of his manacles. He will turn up as his benefactor.\n\nLuck, luck and luck. But then systematically Dickens shatters every single opportunity and hope on the side of the boy, Pip, who ends up in prison for unpaid debts, on the side of his benefactor, Abel, who will die in prison holding Pip's hand after his final arrest, on the side of Miss Havisham who will achieve none of her plans, on the side of Estella who will marry the rich and noble young man, will be brutalized and will end up alone in Miss Havisham's house, on the side of Biddy who will marry Joe the Blacksmith when Pip finally realizes she had been his closest ever friend, and even on the side of Estella who will refuse to requite Pip's love, though she will accept to make him her platonic companion in Miss Havisham's.redecorated house.\n\nThat cruelty is so extreme that we just wonder if Dickens then is not going through a phase of complete social rejection, rejection of the upper classes, rejection of the lower classes, rejection of justice, rejection of any discourse about the possible improvement of individuals and society. Absolute resignation and pessimistic submission to a totally inhumane world that only has some small pockets of satisfaction, but never for yourself, always for some rare others. He did not even salvage the exiled criminal who became Pip's benefactor, as Victor Hugo did in Les Misrables, and makes him die a solitary, nearly solitary death in prison with the sole company of the young man he tried and failed to help, and unaware of his daughter's fate, which does not seem to be particularly brilliant anyway, since she is Estella, daughter of a female assassin and a male exiled criminal condemned to absolute reclusion for life.\n\nI just wonder if here Dickens does not reach Zola's pessimism who considered that anyone born in a criminal circle could only be that and drag everyone around him down into that criminal circle. No salvation for those who are badly born. The belief in an elected people turned into a savage and wild social Darwinism: some have been elected to be crushed and powdered by life as slowly as possible for them to regret ever being born but absolutely unable to shorten the ordeal.\n\nSad and sad and sad.\n\nDr Jacques COULARDEAU", "summary": "One of Dickens's stories that have no happy ending at all", "unixReviewTime": 1301356800}

Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)\n\n- This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.\n\n- Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.\n\n- This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.\n\nOne positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen. A second positive is that the acting is this production is just as good as the 1981 adaptation.\n\nIn summary:\nI prefer the 1981 version best (even though I would only give it a 4 star). However, this production is better than the 1974 Michael York/Sarah Miles adaptation, which completely eliminates the character of Orlick.\n\nFor people who want a film to watch for pleasure (rather than to prepare for a major content examination), this adaptation may be the most interesting and best choice. Otherwise, I would recommend the much longer 1981 adaptation.", "summary": "An average production....", "unixReviewTime": 1243468800}

Ioan Gruffuld's Pip, likewise, is more frightened as a child, more vulnerable as an adult, than we have ever seen him before. Estella is crueler and more beautiful. The mood throughout, from Pip's strange encounter in the graveyard, to his peculiar encounter with Orlick, to his final encounter with Estella, is often more grim, never more comic than the Dickens. A cloud seems to hang over everything, even its brightest comic moments, offered up in the movie by Wemmick and Herbert.\n\nOften, what works well in a novel does not work well on screen.

I give the 1947-version 4-stars. The 1947-version is good.\n\nIn this 2004-version; actress, Justine Waddell, who was great as the sweet and wonderful Molly in \"Wives and Daughters\", co-stars. Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version\n\nThe 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.\n\nThe book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: \"Oliver Twist\" 1839, \"A Christmas Carol\" 1843, and \"David Copperfield\" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story \"Great Expectations\" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of \"Great Expectations\" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.\n\nCharles Dickens's book \"Oliver Twist\" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The \"Oliver Twist\" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play \"Oliver Twist\"; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story \"Great Expectations\" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps. Yet, even with the bumps; the 1947-version is a good story.", "summary": "The 1947-version is the one to watch.", "unixReviewTime": 1175731200}

Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's telling of Great Expectations accounts for many of the most important parts of the story, and those who have never read the book (or, those who chose not to read it in high school), will have an easy time understanding the story of Pip's rise and fall in both love and status. Certainly this is not some cheesy modern remake that tries to be hip and cool; instead it modernizes the tale in a way that is very \"Dickenseque.\"\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of the film is characterization. Some may see Estella and Miss Havisham as being a little more \"sensitive and kind\" in this version compared to the novel, but overall they fit their roles well. Ioan Gruffudd does a superb job of Pip as an adult, who learns of his great expectations and tries to use these to gain a better status in life .Abel Magwitch, who is the convict who helps Pip earn a better life, is also played very similar to the character in the novel. I also felt that Joe was depicted essentially as the character in the book, and he really brings to life his love for Pip despite the fact that Pip at times resents him. Some of the other minor characters are also fun to watch: Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Mr. Pumblechook, Herbert Pocket, Biddy. The great thing about Dickens' characters is that they are unique and, at times, eccentric and, as a viewer, you can readily identify those characteristics as they come up in the film.\n\nAnother aspect of the film that was refreshing was just the scenery. The scene at the beginning with Pip encountering the convict in the cemetery, the grassland scene at the beginning and the end of the movie, and the dreariness of London (as Pip first arrives) all seem to be very illustrative of the attitude of the film.\n\nOne disappointing aspect of the film was that, at times, it was too obvious and blatant. It's almost as if the director decided that people were \"too lazy\" to understand certain parts, so they just thought they'd have a character \"fill in\" exactly what happened  rather than trying to let you decide on your own or show the scene the way it was intended. One example of this is the conflicts between Pip and Orlick.\n\nApproximately 3 hours in length, this film still manages to cut quite a bit from the book and seem relatively short in length. I highly recommend this version, and it is much better than the Ethan Hawke/ Gwyneth Paltrow version of Great Expectations, which is very loose in its translation.\n\nIf you are looking for a modernized version of a great classic by Dickens, this is it. This film also works well for any teachers who want to do a comparison between the film and the book.\n\n4  stars", "summary": "Modern, but very true to the story", "unixReviewTime": 1151884800}
